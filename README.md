# Freepik Premium Cost – Is It Worth the Investment?
Freepik Premium costs around $9.99 per month, with annual plans available at a discounted rate of approximately $7.50 per month when billed yearly. This investment offers exceptional value for those regularly using design assets, given the access to exclusive resources, enhanced download limits, and no-attribution usage rights. Compared to purchasing individual licenses or paying for multiple subscriptions, Freepik Premium’s cost is affordable for both freelancers and businesses. If you’re frequently in need of fresh visuals, upgrading to Premium can streamline your workflow and provide a cost-effective, high-quality design library.
